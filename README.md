# Functionality
In our final project, we have designed a music tempo game. The concept of the game is to press the button on the Keypad of the FPGA board and earn points when you successfully press the right button when objects drop down shown on the board. We will demonstrate and describe the details below.

Initially, when the game is programmed onto the board, there would be nothing but a line on the screen of the LCD.

The starting gameview. ![Alt text](/pic/Pacmo_start.jpg)
* The pin in the upper right corner: <br />
This is where the songs are chose and selected.(the two on the leftmost). The rightmost PIN controls to Start or not.
* The LED light in the button: <br />
LED lights up responding to the song youâ€™ve chosen and whether the game has started or not.


When the game starts, different pictures will appear from the top of the LCD screen. There are three different pictures. One is the note of music, another one is a cute mushroom character, and the last one is the PAC-MAN. These three characters are designed to make the game more entertaining and fun. The pattern of their appearance is chosen randomly. They would each fall down from the top of the screen to the line on the below and then disappear. The player should press down the corresponding keys on the keypad in order to earn points in this game. The keys are 0,1,4,and 7. The keys that the players are required to press are relative to the situation of the characters on the LCD screen. If the character is now situated on the leftmost of the screen, then the player should press 1, in order to earn points.
